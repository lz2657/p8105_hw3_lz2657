Problem 1
---------

First, read and manipulate the data as required.

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response =="Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response =="Poor")
brfss_data$response = factor(brfss_data$response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))

brfss_data
```

    ## # A tibble: 10,625 x 23
    ##     year locationabbr locationdesc class topic question response
    ##    <int> <chr>        <chr>        <chr> <chr> <chr>    <fct>   
    ##  1  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Excelle~
    ##  2  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Very go~
    ##  3  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Good    
    ##  4  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Fair    
    ##  5  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Poor    
    ##  6  2010 AL           AL - Mobile~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Excelle~
    ##  7  2010 AL           AL - Mobile~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Very go~
    ##  8  2010 AL           AL - Mobile~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Good    
    ##  9  2010 AL           AL - Mobile~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Fair    
    ## 10  2010 AL           AL - Mobile~ Heal~ Over~ How is ~ Poor    
    ## # ... with 10,615 more rows, and 16 more variables: sample_size <int>,
    ## #   data_value <dbl>, confidence_limit_low <dbl>,
    ## #   confidence_limit_high <dbl>, display_order <int>,
    ## #   data_value_unit <chr>, data_value_type <chr>,
    ## #   data_value_footnote_symbol <chr>, data_value_footnote <chr>,
    ## #   data_source <chr>, class_id <chr>, topic_id <chr>, location_id <chr>,
    ## #   question_id <chr>, respid <chr>, geo_location <chr>

Question 1:

``` r
count_states_2002 = count(count(subset(brfss_data, year == 2002), locationabbr, locationdesc), locationabbr)
filter(count_states_2002, nn == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   locationabbr    nn
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 FL               7
    ## 3 NC               7

In 2002, only CT, FL and NC were observed at 7 locations.

Question 2:

``` r
count_states_year = count(count(brfss_data, year, locationabbr, locationdesc), year, locationabbr)

ggplot(data = count_states_year, aes(x = year, y = nn, colour = locationabbr)) +
labs(list(title = "year - number of locations", y = paste("number of locations"))) + 
geom_line(size=0.5)
```

Here is the required spaghetti plot and I enlarge the size of it to make it clearer.

Question 3:

``` r
brfss_exclt_prop = subset(brfss_data, locationabbr == "NY" & response == "Excellent" & (year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(data_value), sd = sd(data_value))

brfss_exclt_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##    year  mean    sd
    ##   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1  2002  24.0  4.49
    ## 2  2006  22.5  4.00
    ## 3  2010  22.7  3.57

The mean of the proportion of "Excellent" doensn't have large changes while the sd of it was decreasing.

Question 4:

``` r
brfss_prop = brfss_data %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(data_value))
ggplot(subset(brfss_prop, !is.na(mean)), aes(x = year, y = mean, color = response)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ response)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_lz2657_files/figure-markdown_github/problem1_question4-1.png)

The plot is shown above. The proportion of "Very good" is the highest and that of "Poor" is the lowest. All the proportions of the responses other than "Excellent" were almost unchange. The proportion of "Excellent" had decreased for about 2 percent during the period.

Problem 2
---------

Question 1:

``` r
n_distinct(instacart_data$aisle_id)
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
count_aisle_item = instacart_data %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  summarize(items_number = n())
count_aisle_item[which.max(count_aisle_item$items_number),2]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   aisle           
    ##   <chr>           
    ## 1 fresh vegetables

``` r
max(count_aisle_item$items_number)
```

    ## [1] 150609

There are 134 aisles and most items are ordered from fresh vegetables, which has 150609 items.
